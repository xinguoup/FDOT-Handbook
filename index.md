Traffic analysis is the process of evaluating the effect of traffic demand and supply on the performance of a transportation facility in relation to meeting goals and objectives of the facility. Demand is the amount of traffic load that intends to use the facility while supply is the capacity of the facility to handle the demand. The goals and objectives not only provide guidance to the transportation planning process, but are also used to evaluate the implementation and operation of the facility. The goals can be categorized as related to mobility, reliability, accessibility, safety, economy, or environmental preservation.

There are different levels of traffic analysis which can be grouped as:

- Generalized (sketch-level) planning analysis.
- Preliminary engineering and Design analysis.
- Operational analysis.

Traffic analysis tools are procedures, methodologies, and computer models used to carry out traffic analyses. These tools differ in their computational capabilities, input requirements, and output measures. Consequently, proper application of each tool to solve traffic problems is a challenge to the transportation practitioners and decision-makers in obtaining reasonable traffic analysis results for the projects. This challenge eventually affects the cost and time to perform transportation projects. Guidance on the uniform and consistent application of traffic analysis tools is therefore needed to overcome this challenge.

Since safety of a transportation facility is correlated with the traffic demand, safety consideration is as important as operational (mobility, reliability, and accessibility) efficiency of the system. As such, safety must be integrated as appropriate in all traffic analysis levels to address safety issues for all users, including pedestrians and bicyclists. This can be achieved by incorporating relevant safety performance measures early in the analysis process.
